# War Card Game

## Game Description
War is a simple card game for two players. It's played with a standard deck of playing cards. The objective is to win all cards.

## Rules
- The deck is divided evenly among the players.
- Each round, both players reveal the top card of their deck – this is a "battle".
- The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards. If the cards are of equal value, it’s a "war".
- During a war, each player draws three cards. The third card determines who wins all six cards.
- Aces are high, and suits are ignored.

## Gameplay
- The game is played in rounds.
- Each round is triggered by the player.
- The output shows each player's card (e.g., '2H' for Two of Hearts) and the winner of the round.
- In case of a war, the game indicates a war round and proceeds accordingly.

## Technical Requirements
- The game should be implemented using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- Clear #comments should be used to describe major sections of the code.
